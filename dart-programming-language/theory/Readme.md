# Introduction to the Dart Programming Language: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide

Have you ever wondered what makes Flutter so powerful for mobile app development? At the core of every Flutter application is **Dart** â€” *a modern, flexible, and efficient programming language designed by Google*. Whether you're developing a mobile, web, or desktop application, understanding Dart is the first step to mastering Flutter.

Dart is known for its fast execution, null safety, and object-oriented structure, making it an excellent choice for cross-platform development. It supports both **Just-in-Time (JIT)** and **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** compilation, Enabling developers to create applications with **hot reload (feature in Dart and Flutter that allows developers to see changes in their code instantly without restarting the entire application)** for quick iterations during development and optimized performance for production. 

Additionally, Dartâ€™s asynchronous programming capabilities simplify handling network requests, database operations, and background tasks. With a syntax similar to JavaScript and Java, itâ€™s easy for developers to learn and transition into Flutter development.

Now that we understand why Dart is essential for Flutter, letâ€™s start with setting up Dart on our system. ðŸš€

2. **Add Dart bin folder path to System PATH**

    To make dart is accessible globally, add its directory to the system's PATH variable:

    - **Open Environment variables** 

        <img src="./open-edit-the-system-environment-variables.png" alt="open-edit-the-system-environment-variables" width=90%/>
        <img src="./environment-variable-system-variables.png" alt="environment-variable-system-variables" width=90%/>

    - **Paste the bin folder path here and click *OK***

### Verification

1. **Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type**

    ```
        dart --version
    ```

### Change the Dart Cli Console 

1. **Open Settings**

    <img src="./dart-change-settings.png" alt="dart-change-settings" width=90%/>

2. **Search for dart in the search bar, scroll down to CLI Console, and change it to Terminal**

### Add the given code to the file

```
    void main(){
        print("Hello! Dart, Here is My First Program...");
    }
    // void main() â†’ The main function is where execution begins.
    // print() â†’ Used to display output in the console.
```

### Run the code 

1. **Click on Run**

    <img src="./dart-first-program-run.png" alt= "dart-first-program-run" width=90% />

2. **Output**

    <img src="./dart-first-program-output.png" alt= "dart-first-program-output" width=90% />

## Dart Syntax Basics

### Dart Statements

Every statement in Dart must end with a **semicolon (;)**, which tells the compiler that the statement is complete.

### Dart program starts with a *main()* function, which serves as the entry point.

### Comments in Dart
Comments are non-executable line of codes. These are essential for writing readable code.

1. **Single-line Comments**

    ```
        // Hi! I am Single Line Comment
    ```
2. **Multi-line Comments**

    ```
        /* Hi! I am 
        Muti Line 
        Comment */
    ```

### Dart Data Types

- Dart is a statically typed language, meaning that variables have a specific type at compile time. 
- Various data types categorized into 
    - **primitive types :** 
        - the basic building blocks of the language that represent simple values
        - It includes :
            - **int** :  Used for whole numbers without decimal points.
            - **double** : Used for decimal numbers.
            - **String** : Used for Sequence of characters enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes.
            - **bool** : Used to represent true or false values.

        ```
            void main(){
                int a=23;
                double b=45.09;
                String c="dart_program";
                bool d=true;
                print(a);    //23
                print(b);   // 45.09
                print(c);  // dart_program
                print(d); // true
            }
        ```

    - **collection types :** 
        - Collections help store multiple values in a single variable
        - It includes :
            - **List (Ordered Collection, Similar to Arrays)** : A List is an ordered collection of values that can be fixed or growable in size.
            - **Set (Unordered Collection with Unique Elements)** : A Set is an unordered collection of unique values.
            - **Map (Key-Value Pair Collection)** : A Map is a collection of key-value pairs, like a dictionary.

        ```
            void main(){
                List <int> num2=[9,0,8,7,6,5];
                print(num2);                   // [9, 0, 8, 7, 6, 5]
                Set <int> num3={1,4,5,7,8,8,3};
                print(num3);                   // {1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 3}
                Map <String,int> num4={"A":4,"B":8,"C":4};
                print(num4);                   // {A: 4, B: 8, C: 4}
            } 
        ```

    - **special types :**
        - These types provide flexibility in how variables are declared and used.
        - It includes 
            - **dynamic** :  
                - It can hold a value of any type.
                - It can be reassigned to another type later.
                - It is used when the "type" is determined at runtime.

                ```
                    void main(){
                        dynamic c="Demo";
                        c=45;
                        print(c);   // 45
                    }
                ```
            - **var** :  
                - It is similar to dynamic but the type is determined at compile time.
                - Once a type is assigned to a var variable, it cannot change.

                ```
                    void main(){
                        var c="Demo";
                        // c=45;  // Error: A value of type 'int' can't be assigned to a variable of type 'String'
                        c="dart-program";
                        print(c);      // dart-program
                    }
                ```

            - **Object** : 
                - Object is the root class of all Dart types, meaning every type in Dart (whether built-in or user-defined) is a subclass of Object.
                - It is used when the "type" is determined at compile time.

                ```
                    void main(){
                        Object a="45";
                        a=89;             // Dart does not track the latest type of Object at runtime.
                        int b=a as int;   // forcefully casting "a" to an int, but if "a" was still a String, it would crash
                        print(b+30);     // 119
                    }
                ```

    - **nullable types :**
        - Nullable types allow a variable to store either a value or null. 
        - By default, Dart follows null safety, meaning variables cannot be null unless explicitly specified.

        ```
            void main(){
                String? name="aka";  // Can store a string or null (without "?" null is not allowed)
                print(name);         // aka
            }
        ```

# Introduction to the Dart Programming Language: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide

Have you ever wondered what makes Flutter so powerful for mobile app development? At the core of every Flutter application is **Dart** â€” *a modern, flexible, and efficient programming language designed by Google*. Whether you're developing a mobile, web, or desktop application, understanding Dart is the first step to mastering Flutter.

Dart is known for its fast execution, null safety, and object-oriented structure, making it an excellent choice for cross-platform development. It supports both **Just-in-Time (JIT)** and **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** compilation, Enabling developers to create applications with **hot reload (feature in Dart and Flutter that allows developers to see changes in their code instantly without restarting the entire application)** for quick iterations during development and optimized performance for production. 

Additionally, Dartâ€™s asynchronous programming capabilities simplify handling network requests, database operations, and background tasks. With a syntax similar to JavaScript and Java, itâ€™s easy for developers to learn and transition into Flutter development.

Now that we understand why Dart is essential for Flutter, letâ€™s start with setting up Dart on our system. ðŸš€

2. **Add Dart bin folder path to System PATH**

    To make dart is accessible globally, add its directory to the system's PATH variable:

    - **Open Environment variables** 

        <img src="./open-edit-the-system-environment-variables.png" alt="open-edit-the-system-environment-variables" width=90%/>
        <img src="./environment-variable-system-variables.png" alt="environment-variable-system-variables" width=90%/>

    - **Paste the bin folder path here and click *OK***

### Verification

1. **Open Command Prompt (cmd) and type**

    ```
        dart --version
    ```
